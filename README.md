Case Study: Implementing Stack-like Behavior Using a Queue in a User Profile Processing System
A Corporation is a rapidly growing online platform that provides various services to its users. 
The platform handles a large number of user profiles and their associated data. 
As the user base continues to expand, XYZ Corporation faces challenges in efficiently processing user profile requests while maintaining data integrity and system performance.

Solution
A Corporation decided to implement a stack-like behavior for processing user profile requests using a queue. They chose the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for their application.
Here's how they implemented this solution:
Queue Implementation: They created a queue, called userProfileRequestQueue, to hold user profile request IDs. This queue stores incoming requests for user profile data.
Enqueue Requests: Whenever a user profile request is received, it is enqueued at the end of the userProfileRequestQueue. This ensures that the most recent requests are processed first, simulating a stack-like behavior (Last-In, First-Out or LIFO).
Processing Middleware: A Corporation implemented a processing middleware function called processUserProfileRequests. This middleware periodically checks the queue for pending requests and processes them.
Asynchronous Processing: The processing of user profiles is performed asynchronously. The middleware dequeues user profile request IDs, fetches the corresponding user profile data from the database, and processes it as needed. Any errors are handled gracefully.
Response Handling: When user profile data is successfully processed, responses are sent to the users, providing them with their profile information. In cases where a user profile does not exist, appropriate error responses are sent.
